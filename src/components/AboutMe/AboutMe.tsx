    <h2>Hi there!</h2>
    <p>ðŸ”­ I'm diving into Computer Systems, System Security,Deep learning and Real-Time Systems for Embeded Systems by identifying niche research papers on the same, extrapolating and implementing.</p>
    <p>ðŸŒ± In my Real-Time Systems class, I'm learning further C and C++ and getting hands-on with Managing Complex Systems and Complex Software Projects. I'm also exploring Operating Systems, involving myself in the BSD and overall Unix Systems!</p>
    <p>ðŸ‘¯ I love collaborating on open source projects, especially those that involve user security, or anything that puts users first. Check out my projects on GitHub!</p>
    <h5>My interests mainly lie in: </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Full-stack (both frontend & backend) development</li>
      <li>Systems</li>
      <li>Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks/ Deep Learning</li>
      <li>Fintech</li>
      <li>Distributed systems & DevOps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ðŸª´ My passion lies in applying natural language processing, neural networks and machine learning algorithms to uncover
      implicit patterns and insights within large collections of threat detection data, enabling
      high-end threat monitoring syatems. My ultimate goal is to
      enhance secure systems by incorporating AI and System security, fostering secure human-computer interaction.
